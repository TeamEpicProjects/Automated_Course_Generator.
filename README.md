# Automated_Course_Generator
Automatic Course Content Generator (ACCG) is an AI-based Streamlit application. It generates a complete course and makes necessary modifications. The application also generates quiz questions along with the complete course, which can be conveniently downloaded as a PDF. 

#Steps:

STEP 1 - In order to run the application on your local system, you would need to generate your open API key and you will have to store the key in a .env file in the following format:
OPENAI_API_KEY="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

STEP 2 - After generating the key, you would be required to open the command prompt (given that you have python installed on your system) and create a new environment where you would need to install the required libraries as mentioned in the requirements.txt file.

STEP 3 - Once you have done this you just need to give the command "streamlit run app.py"

STEP 4 - Your application should run smoothly.
